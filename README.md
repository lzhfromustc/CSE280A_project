compressed_data: contains filtered Tandem Repeat data and compressed FNA file of three dolphins

trf_parser: code that generates the data in compressed_data. It takes the original .fna file, and .html files generated by Tandem Repeats Finder as inputs. It parses these files, filters Tandem Repeats, and compresses .fna file to only remain slices of sequences around reserved Tanden Repeats. The input files of trf_parser is not in this repository, because their size is too big. If you really want them, contact zil060@ucsd.edu

final_step_analyzer: code that takes results/experiment_6_raw.csv as input, and prints some statistics and generates results/snp.txt. results/some_statistics.txt is the output of this tool.
