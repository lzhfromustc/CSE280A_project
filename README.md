**Contents of directories**

`compressed_data`: contains filtered Tandem Repeat data and compressed FNA file of three dolphins

`trf_parser`: code that generates the data in `compressed_data`. It takes the original .fna file, and all the .html files generated by Tandem Repeats Finder as inputs. It parses these files, filters Tandem Repeats, and compresses .fna file to only remain slices of sequences around reserved Tanden Repeats. The input files of `trf_parser` is not in this repository, because their size is too big

`final_step_analyzer`: code that takes `results/experiment_6_raw.csv` as input, and prints some statistics and generates `results/snp.txt`. `results/some_statistics.txt` is the output of this tool.

`results`: inputs and outputs of `final_step_analyzer`
